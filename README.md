# PAL  - User Guide

## Introduction

**PAL (PLC Applications Linker)** is a *Matlab*-based
framework developed by the *Wind Energy Institute* at
the *Technical University of Munich*, providing a
seamless solution for developing, deploying, and
testing interconnected applications on real-time PLC
systems, specifically compatible with *Bachmann M1
systems*. PAL addresses key challenges in research
projects, simplifying the deployment of interconnected *Simulink* models on PLC systems.
Noteworthy strengths include facilitating *easier
model deployment*, streamlining collaboration by
establishing a shared PLC, ensuring confidentiality
through modular development, fostering enhanced
research cooperation, providing adaptability for
runtime changes, and generating simple text outputs
for effective experiment monitoring. PAL empowers
researchers, even those without extensive PLC
knowledge, to deploy applications on real-time
machines, contributing to efficient experimentation
and collaboration within industrial projects.
