# PAL  - User Guide

## Introduction

**PAL (PLC Applications Linker)** is a *Matlab*-based
framework developed by the *Wind Energy Institute* of
the *Technical University of Munich*, providing a
framework for developing, deploying, and
testing interconnected applications on real-time PLC
systems, specifically compatible with *Bachmann M1
systems*. PAL addresses key challenges in research
projects, simplifying the deployment of interconnected *Simulink* models on PLC systems.
PAL includes a user-friendly graphics user interface (GUI) for model deployment on real-time systems, streamlining collaboration by
establishing a shared PLC, ensuring confidentiality
through modular development and generating simple text outputs
for effective experiment monitoring. The basic idea of PAL is to give
researchers, even those without extensive PLC
knowledge, the ability to deploy applications on real-time
machines, contributing to efficient experimentation
and collaboration within academic and industrial projects.
