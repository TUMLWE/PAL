KeyName,KeyType,Description
InputNumber,String,"Unique number identifying a main ITFC variable. Consecutive entries with same input number are considered subfields of the main structure"
TagName,String,Tag name of the structure/variable/subfield
VarName,String,"Internal variable name in generated code, as a default this can be set equal to TagName"
AppName,String,"appTag of ITFC application  the variable belongs to. Not necessary for subfields. ITFC must be present in ""inputfile.xlsx"""
VarType,String/struct,"MATLAB Data type of the variable. Must be included in data type conversion dictionary between Matlab and PLC. If variable is a structure, it must be set to ""struct"""
VarSize,Integer,"If variable is a structure, VarSize should be the sum of the Bytes of its subfields. See here for examples. If variable is a subfield, only VarSize equal to 1 is allowed for numerical variables, while it can be longer for ""char"" variables. If it is a main variable, any number of array length is allowed."
Access,READ/WRITE,"It must match the ""Action"" of the corresponding HOST variable. Set READ if the variable is read by HOST or WRITE if the variable is written by HOST"
Create,TRUE/FALSE,"When set to FALSE, the variable is ignored"
